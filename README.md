# Random Ball Party

This was a challenge in the second or third week of the MIT coding bootcamp I am taking that I really enjoyed diving into.  It is intended to showcase my ability to manipulate DOM elements using javascript.

• click the + button to add a randomly sized, velocity, colored, and located 'ball'

• click the - button to delete one randomly generated ball at a time.

## Future Improvements

I could clear the intervals when the DOM elements are removed.  As of right now, they just run regardless of whether or not you can see the balls bouncing.
